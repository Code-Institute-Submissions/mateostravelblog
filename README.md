# **Mateo’s Travel Blog**

Welcome to Mateo’s Travel Blog, my person travel. MTB for short covers my most recent travels abroad. In travel blog, provide a short description of each country I visited as well as tips to prospective travelers that are new to the traveling scene. I give my site visitors the opportunity to share their experiences and travel tips with me to better improve my website with more information.


## **UX**

Using the five planes of user experience (strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface), I devolved my website for a target audience that is:
- Male and females, between ages 18-30.
    - Unexperienced travelers, looking for travel advice.
    - Experienced travelers, that can share their tips and experiences with me.
    
Below, under User Stories, I further explain my target audience.

User Stories
- An “Unexperienced Traveler” is defined as a user who is new to traveling abroad. They will land on my site to learn of my travel experiences and to gain travel tips that will aid them in their planning. They will be encouraged to follow my tips.
- An “Experienced Traveler” is defined as a user who has traveled abroad in the past. They will land on my site to read about my experiences and travel tips. They will then be encouraged to contact me with their own experiences and travel tips they think I should add to my site.


### <ins>Strategy:</ins>
What is the focus: what's worth doing?
- What is worth doing is creating a website where I can share my personal experiences and some travel tips with other travel fanatics and potential first-time travelers.
- I am looking for those who are experienced to share with me their personal stories and tips after reading mine.
- I am looking for the unexperienced travelers to learn about my experiences and to encourage them to follow my travel tips.
- It is also worth proving my expertise and credibility by providing proof of my travels through images.

What is created: what am I creating?
- I am creating a website that will serve as an outlet to share my experiences while informing and encouraging site visitors to try out my travel tips on their next adventure abroad.
- A simple blog post on a site like Facebook or Instagram would not suffice the full message I am trying to get across. That is why I am creating this website.

What is the value: what value does my site provide?
- Site visitors are given a showcase of the countries I’ve visited.
- They also receive tips for their next trip abroad.
- Site visitors are also given access to some hyperlinks of locations I have visited within certain countries.
- Users are also given an opportunity to share with me their own experiences and travel tips. The pitch will be for travel fanatics to share any tips they think would go well on the site.

### <ins>Scope:</ins>
Features:
- A home page site map for ease of access. Although the site is small now, as it grows, the map will help user get to their desired final destination. I plan to play around with the site map and make it look like an actual map.
- One singular experience page with ease to read short summaries of each country I’ve visited.
- As mentioned earlier, the experience page will also contain hyperlink to certain places I’ve visited in each respective country.
- Image galleries under each country summary are to give myself credibility and provide clean aesthetics to my site.
- Travel tips will be presented in an easy to read format that will be aesthetically pleasing. Each tip will be in a card format attached to an image/gif related to that specific topic.
- Site visitors are given a chance to contact me through a form with any comments, personal experiences, or recommended travel tips they want to share.
- Each page will contain its own unique header image with either my site logo or a travel quote.


### <ins>Structure:</ins>
Navigation
- The navigation will be split into four tabs (Listed in priority of importance and relevance to the user):
    - Home/Index
    - My Experiences
    - Travel Tips
    - Contact

Jumbotron Header Image
- Over the header image on each page, will be a button that will guide users to the corresponding next page. See **Features** below for a more detailed overview.

Image Galleries
- The image gallery will be placed underneath each country summary under the experience tab.
- This is to minimize the amount of clicks it’ll take a user to see my images. Also adds to website cleanliness.

Experiences (Visible from MD to XS – See Features for more details)
- To simplify user experience, when on screen sizes smaller than MD, users will see the following structure for each country:
    - Country Name | Single Image | Summary of Experience

Footer Structure
- Each page will also contain a footer with hyperlinks to my other social media accounts. This will help to establish rapport between the user and myself.


### <ins>Skeleton:</ins>

- Please refer to the PDF file called skeleton-layout.pdf
    - The file is located in the assets folder under the mockup subfolder.

Displayed in Home Page (Located in index.html)

1. Site Map
-	The site map is a short directory to the various pages on my site. It is meant to help guide users to the information they are seeking without having to click through each tab in the Navbar.
-	The site map contains logos that represent the topic of each page. When hovering over the logo or clicking on the logo on small screens, the logo will increase in size for aesthetic.



Displayed on My Experiences (Located in experiences.html)

1. Bootstrap Horizontal Dropdown Menu (Visible only from XL to LG Screen Sizes)
- The “My Experiences” tab will contain a dropdown menu taken from bootstrap. The vertical menu is styled so that when hovering over a country name, the name will increase in size to let a user know to click.
- Only one menu tab/country can be opened at one time. This is to help minimize the amount of information that is presented to a user at a time.

2. Interactive Image Gallery (Visible only from XL to LG Screen Sizes)
- Within each dropdown menu tab/country, will be an interactive image gallery for each respective country. When hovering over each image, the image will push aside the remaining images to enlarge and give the user a clear view of each image.

3. Simplified View (Visible only from MD to XS Screen Sizes)
- To simplify the user experience, when on screen sizes smaller than MD, users will no longer see the bootstrap dropdown menu, but rather will see the following structure for each country:
    - Country Name | Single Image | Summary of Experience



Displayed in Travel Tips (Located in travel-tips.html)

1. Interactive Cards
- The interactive travel cards will provide text that is hidden unless hovered over or click on.



Displayed in Contact Page (Located in contact.html)

1. Contact Form
- A form will allow site visitors to submit to me comments, questions, and their stories that they think are relevant for me to hear.





### Features Left to Implement


Displayed in Home Page (Located in index.html)

1. Site Map Expansion
- As the site grows, I plan to expand my home page site map to look more like an actual map. This will provide more ease to site visitors when looking for specific information.


Displayed on My Experiences (Located in experiences.html)

1. Dropdown Menu Expansion
- I plan to add flags as background images to the bootstrap dropdown menu. I think it will look more aesthetically pleasing to hover over each country tab and have the respective flag with a dark overlay appear.
