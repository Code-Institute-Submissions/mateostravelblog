							<p>I visited Belgium in 2015 while I was studying abroad. I planned the trip to Brussels,
								Belgium, with a few friends. All of the expenses were paid, and all that was left to do
								was hop on the plane. A week before the trip, the unimaginable occurred. In November of
								2015, the <a
									href=" https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/europe/2015-paris-terror-attacks-fast-facts/index.html"
									target="_blank">Paris Terror Attacks</a> brought the world to a halt. A group of
								merciless terrorists killed over 100 people in one single night. At the time, I was in
								Berlin, studying abroad.</p>
							<p>With the fear of getting caught in an anti-refugee demonstration (which did occur once in
								Prague), mixed with the anxiety of a copycat terrorist attack, the trip to Belgium
								almost got canceled. Somehow, someway, I managed to convince my parents that it was safe
								to travel to Brussels, Belgium. I told my parents that the only way those terrorists
								would win is if we let them instill fear into our hearts. I was young and determined to
								live my life. All of my friends did the same. The trip was still on!</p>

							<p>On arrival to Brussels, Belgium, I met up with my friends to visit some monuments and to
								try the world-famous Belgian waffles! All of the hype is no lie -- the waffles were
								delicious!</p>

							<p>To end the night, we visited the renowned <a href="https://www.deliriumvillage.com/"
									target="_blank">Delirium
									Café</a>, a bar where you can try over 2000 beers from all across the world. Some of
								the beer brands we tried were unpronounceable, but it left us wanting more! The café was
								a fantastic experience.</p>

							<p>On our way back to our hostel, we were met with an eerie sight. The Belgian army was
								patrolling the streets in their riot gear and military tanks. The view of the military
								in the streets was an eye-opening experience. In the morning, we learned that the
								mastermind behind the Paris Terror Attacks was a Belgian national who was likely
								planning an attack in Brussels. Everyone at the hostel was on edge. We were a target due
								to the vast number of Americans in one central location. The Belgian government put the
								entire city on a level 5 terror alert.</p>

							<p>As we were all thinking our trip was over, one of my friends got a call from an aunt that
								lived nearby. She offered to drop us off in Waterloo, Brussels, to salvage our trip. And
								boy, was she right. The trip turned out even better than I expected. We visited the
								beautiful <a href="https://www.waterloo1815.be/en/" target="_blank">Mémorial Waterloo
									1815</a>. I climbed the 226 steps to get to the top of the Lion's Mound, which gave
								me an incomparable view of the Waterloo battlefield.</p>

							<p>Undoubtedly, Belgium was a fantastic experience. The roadblocks on the trip were just
								temporary for my friends and me, but for the people of Belgium, the potential risk of a
								threat to their lives remains very genuine.</p>

							<p>Mexico, my home far away from home. Whenever I’m available, I try to visit Mexico every
								December with my dad. Mexico, during the winter holiday season is very beautiful. The
								markets are out and the fair comes into town.</p>

							<p>I grew up in a small town called Urireo, Guanajuato, Mexico. It’s located about 4 hours
								North West of Mexico City. Both my mother and father originate from Urireo. Urireo has a
								very humble and calming atmosphere. The people are sweet and kind. The culture is very
								family oriented and engraved in Catholic roots. Most homes in Urireo were built on the
								slanted hills and valleys. When you enter a typical home in Urireo, the first thing you
								notice is a small courtyard without a roof. These courtyards usually contain a pila para
								lavar or in English, a pool to wash. A pila is a square shaped tub or pool made out of
								concrete. The pilas are filled with water and used to wash dished and sometimes clothes.
							</p>

							<p>You might also notice that since the homes are on the side of hills, you have to fight
								gravity when standing by swaying forward. The people are used to their way of life, but
								as a foreigner, it sometimes strikes me as interesting. But living in the mountain area
								is not all that tough. You build a lot of leg muscle with the amount of walking you do
								in Urireo. The mountain scenery is to die for as well.</p>

							<p>Apart from Urireo, I love visiting the neighboring cities including Mexico City and
								Guanajuato. In Mexico City you have the Basílica de Guadalupe and right on the
								outskirts you have the ancient Aztec Pyramid ruins of San Juan Teotihuacán. All great
								attractions!</p>

							<p>When I visited the United Kingdom, the first thing that caught me by surprise was the

								Dollar, but I was taken back by the vast difference. Fortunately, I had saved enough for
								the trip, but a word to the wise, make sure you have a budget for when traveling to the
								UK.</p>

							<p>On the bright side, my experience in the UK was beyond my wildest dreams. Luckily, I had
								a group of friends to share the experience within London. One of those friends was well
								versed in the architecture of the city. He guided us to the various monuments and
								buildings.
								We visited the London Eye, the Gherkin, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the Tower
								Bridge, just to name a few.</p>

							<p>But above all, my favorite location that I visited was the Emirates Stadium. Home of
								Arsenal Football Club! Arsenal has been one of my favorite teams since I was a little
								boy. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time in my trip to stop and watch a game, but I
								was super excited to visit the Arsenal home. I even got to buy a jersey and meet the
								team mascot, Gunnersaurus!</p>

							gravity when standing by swaying forward. The people are used to their way of life, but
							as a foreigner, it sometimes strikes me as interesting. But living in the mountain area
							is not all that tough. You build a lot of leg muscle with the amount of walking you do
							in Urireo. The mountain scenery is to die for as well.</p>

						<p>Apart from Urireo, I love visiting the neighboring cities including Mexico City and
							Guanajuato. In Mexico City you have the Basílica de Guadalupe and right on the
							outskirts you have the ancient Aztec Pyramid ruins of San Juan Teotihuacán. All great
							attractions!</p>

						<p>When I visited the United Kingdom, the first thing that caught me by surprise was the
							exchange rate from US Dollars to Pounds. I knew the Pound was stronger than the US
							Dollar, but I was taken back by the vast difference. Fortunately, I had saved enough for
							the trip, but a word to the wise, make sure you have a budget for when traveling to the
							UK.</p>

						<p>On the bright side, my experience in the UK was beyond my wildest dreams. Luckily, I had
							a group of friends to share the experience within London. One of those friends was well
							versed in the architecture of the city. He guided us to the various monuments and
							buildings.
							We visited the London Eye, the Gherkin, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the Tower
							Bridge, just to name a few.</p>

						<p>But above all, my favorite location that I visited was the Emirates Stadium. Home of
							Arsenal Football Club! Arsenal has been one of my favorite teams since I was a little
							boy. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time in my trip to stop and watch a game, but I
							was super excited to visit the Arsenal home. I even got to buy a jersey and meet the
							team mascot, Gunnersaurus!</p>

						<p>To top it all off, yes, I did try the world-famous fish and chips in London, and they did
							not disappoint!</p>
